In Python, primitive data types are the most basic types of data that are built into the language. They represent simple values and are not composed of other data types. The main primitive data types in Python include:

1. int
Represents whole numbers (both positive and negative) with no fractional part.
Example: x = 42
2. float
Represents numbers with a fractional part (decimal values).
Example: pi = 3.14159
3. bool
Represents Boolean values True or False.
Example: is_valid = True
4. str
Represents sequences of characters (text).
Example: name = "Alice"
5. NoneType
Represents the absence of a value; there is only one instance of this type, None.
Example: result = None
Characteristics of Primitive Data Types:
Immutable: Most primitive data types in Python are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed once they are created. For example, strings and numbers are immutable.
Dynamically Typed: In Python, variables do not have a fixed type; the type is determined based on the value assigned to the variable, and it can change at runtime.
These primitive data types serve as the foundation for more complex data structures in Python.
