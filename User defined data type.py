In computer science, a data structure is a logical way of organizing data in computer memory so that it can be used effectively. A data structure allows data to be added, removed, stored and maintained in a structured manner. Python supports two types of data structures:

Non-primitive data types: Python has list, set, and dictionary as its non-primitive data types which can also be considered its in-built data structures.
User-defined data structures: Data structures that arenâ€™t supported by python but can be programmed to reflect the same functionality using concepts supported by python are user-defined data structures. There are many data structure that can be implemented this way:
Linked list
Stack
Queue
Tree
Graph
Hashmap
